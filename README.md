Hi, I’m Martin, current student of Computer Science at the University of Bristol
- I’m interested in Machine Learning/AI and Cyber Security
- I’m currently learning penteting and binary exploitation
- I'm currently working on Toogether social app as a Full-Stack dev and in the future I'll lead the Security and Matchmaking algorithm parts
- How to reach me: oravec.martin01@gmail.com
